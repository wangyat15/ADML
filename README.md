# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic using Machine Learning Algorithms
## Bachelor Thesis

## Introduction
This research explores the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in detecting anomalies within network traffic. This notebook employs the raw data of the UNSW-NB15 dataset to evaluate the performance of several machine learning algorithm, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forests, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

### Comprehensive preprocessing and operations are conducted in this notebook:

- Data cleaning
- Data normalization
- Feature selection
- Data splitting
- Cross validation
